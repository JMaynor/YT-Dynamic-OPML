# YT-Dynamic-OPML

This project is intended for use with FreshRSS or other similar RSS programs. FreshRSS allows using a dynamic OPML file to populate a category of RSS feeds. The idea is to semi-regularly pull the list of public subscriptions from your YouTube channel and populate a locally-hosted OPML file with the corresponding RSS feeds. Allows YouTube to be the canonical list of one's subscriptions but also pull that list into an RSS app in an automatic way.
